In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second state, 47% of the voters are 
Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.

What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state 
than in the first state?

Solution:

For this analysis,

let  P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, 
     P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, 
     p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and 
     p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state

The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and 
the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100

Make sure the sample size is big enough to model differences with a normal population.

  n1P1 = 100 * 0.52 = 52, 
  n1(1 - P1) = 100 * 0.48 = 48, 
  n2P2 = 100 * 0.47 = 47, and 
  n2(1 - P2) = 100 * 0.53 = 53 

All these are greater than 10, the sample size is large enough.

Find the mean of the difference in sample proportions: 

  E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 = 0.52 - 0.47 = 0.05

Find the standard deviation of the difference.

  σd = sqrt{ [ P1(1 - P1) / n1 ] + [ P2(1 - P2) / n2 ] } 
  σd = sqrt{ [ (0.52)(0.48) / 100 ] + [ (0.47)(0.53) / 100 ] } 
  σd = sqrt (0.002496 + 0.002491) = sqrt(0.004987) = 0.0706

This problem requires us to find the probability that p1 is less than p2. This is equivalent to finding the probability 
that p1 - p2 is less than zero. 

To find this probability, we need to transform the random variable (p1 - p2) into a z-score. That transformation appears below.

z p1 - p2 = (x - μ p1 - p2 ) / σd = = (0 - 0.05)/0.0706 = -0.7082

Using Stat Trek's Normal Distribution Calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being -0.7082 or less is 0.24.

Therefore, the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than 
in the first state is 0.24.
